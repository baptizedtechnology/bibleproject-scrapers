##Comments from OpenAI API docs to use:

Timestamps
By default, the Transcriptions API will output a transcript of the provided audio in text. The timestamp_granularities[] parameter enables a more structured and timestamped json output format, with timestamps at the segment, word level, or both. This enables word-level precision for transcripts and video edits, which allows for the removal of specific frames tied to individual words.

Timestamp options
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

audio_file = open("/path/to/file/speech.mp3", "rb")
transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
  file=audio_file,
  model="whisper-1",
  response_format="verbose_json",
  timestamp_granularities=["word"]
)

print(transcription.words)
Longer inputs
By default, the Transcriptions API only supports files that are less than 25 MB. If you have an audio file that is longer than that, you will need to break it up into chunks of 25 MB's or less or used a compressed audio format. To get the best performance, we suggest that you avoid breaking the audio up mid-sentence as this may cause some context to be lost.

One way to handle this is to use the PyDub open source Python package to split the audio:

from pydub import AudioSegment

song = AudioSegment.from_mp3("good_morning.mp3")

# PyDub handles time in milliseconds
ten_minutes = 10 * 60 * 1000

first_10_minutes = song[:ten_minutes]

first_10_minutes.export("good_morning_10.mp3", format="mp3")
OpenAI makes no guarantees about the usability or security of 3rd party software like PyDub.'
